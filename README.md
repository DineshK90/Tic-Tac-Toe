# Tic-Tac-Toe
##GA Project 1
###
####


Thit is a TicTacToe game designed for my first project with General Assembly.

-Establish a base for the game; title, short instruction, playing field, start and reset button
-Simple HTML to start things off
-Js code to ensure winning/lose/draw condition
-Make sure alerts/announcement works on site
-CSS beautification 
-Add in bonuses if possible

###Current idea for game is still basic, will update further if I get ideas on how to make it different, but focusing on the basic functionality for now..
